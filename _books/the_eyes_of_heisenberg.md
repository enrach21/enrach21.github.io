After finding a cool old copy at Green Apple, I had to give this novel a chance. It had Herbert's distinct style in a scifi setting quite different from Dune. I paticular enjoyed the prospective writing about a future of gene editng coming from the 1960s and how it may create burden and divide in our society through the generation of Optimen.
