          , 
            Current pooled CRISPR screens for cis-regulatory elements (CREs), based on transcriptional output changes, are typically limited to characterizing CREs of only one gene. Here, we describe CRISPRpath, a scalable screening strategy for parallelly characterizing CREs of genes linked to the same biological pathway and converging phenotypes. We demonstrate the ability of CRISPRpath for simultaneously identifying functional enhancers of six genes in the 6-thioguanine–induced DNA mismatch repair pathway using both CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn) approaches. Sixty percent of the identified enhancers are known promoters with distinct epigenomic features compared to other active promoters, including increased chromatin accessibility and interactivity. Furthermore, by imposing different levels of selection pressure, CRISPRpath can distinguish enhancers exerting strong impact on gene expression from those exerting weak impact. Our results offer a nuanced view of cis-regulation and demonstrate that CRISPRpath can be leveraged for understanding the complex gene regulatory program beyond transcriptional output at scale.},

However, due to the unbalanced read distribution introduced by protein immunoprecipitation, existing reproducibility measures developed for Hi-C data are not appropriate for the analysis of HiChIP and PLAC-Seq data. Here, we present HPRep, a stratified and weighted correlation metric derived from normalized contact counts, to quantify reproducibility in HiChIP and PLAC-Seq data. We applied HPRep to multiple real datasets and demonstrate that HPRep outperforms existing reproducibility measures developed for Hi-C data. Specifically, we applied HPRep to H3K4me3 PLAC-Seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse brain tissues as well as H3K27ac HiChIP data from human lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 and leukemia cell line K562, showing that HPRep can more clearly separate among pseudo-replicates, real replicates, and non-replicates. Furthermore, in an H3K4me3 PLAC-Seq dataset consisting of 11 samples from four human brain cell types, HPRep demonstrated the expected clustering of data that could not be achieved by existing methods developed for Hi-C data, highlighting the need for a reproducibility metric tailored to HiChIP and PLAC-Seq data.},

            Development of cortical areas begins in cortical stem cells through the action of morphogens controlling the graded expression of transcription factors (TFs). Here, we have systematically identified the TFs and gene regulatory elements (REs) that together control regional pattering of the cortical progenitor zone; these data have led us to propose a cortical regionalization TF network. To identify REs active in this network, we performed TF chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromatin-looping conformation experiments as well as assays for epigenomic marks and DNA accessibility in purified ventricular zone (VZ) progenitor cells in wild-type and patterning mutant mice. This integrated approach has laid the foundations to identify a TF network and cortical VZ REs involved in cortical regional patterning.

              We uncovered a transcription factor (TF) network that regulates cortical regional patterning in radial glial stem cells. Screening the expression of hundreds of TFs in the developing mouse cortex identified 38 TFs that are expressed in gradients in the ventricular zone (VZ). We tested whether their cortical expression was altered in mutant mice with known patterning defects (
              Emx2, Nr2f1
              , and
              Pax6
              ), which enabled us to define a cortical regionalization TF network (CRTFN). To identify genomic programming underlying this network, we performed TF ChIP-seq and chromatin-looping conformation to identify enhancer–gene interactions. To map enhancers involved in regional patterning of cortical progenitors, we performed assays for epigenomic marks and DNA accessibility in VZ cells purified from wild-type and patterning mutant mice. This integrated approach has identified a CRTFN and VZ enhancers involved in cortical regional patterning in the mouse.},

  abstract = {Abstract
            Advances in genomics have led to the identification of many risk loci with hundreds of genes and thousands of DNA variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. A significant barrier to understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases is the lack of functional characterization of risk genes and variants in biological systems relevant to human health and connecting disease-associated variants to pathological phenotypes. Characterizing gene and DNA variant functions requires genetic perturbations followed by molecular and cellular assays of neurobiological phenotypes. However, generating null or mutant alleles is low throughput, making it impossible to characterize disease-associated variants in large quantities efficiently. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens can be leveraged to dissect the biological consequences of the tested genes and variants in their native context. Nevertheless, testing non-coding variants associated with complex diseases remains non-trivial. In this review, we first discuss the current challenges of interpreting the function of the non-coding genome and approaches to prioritizing disease-associated variants in the context of the 3D epigenome. Second, we provide a brief overview of high-throughput CRISPRi and CRISPRa screening strategies applicable for characterizing non-coding sequences in appropriate biological systems. Lastly, we discuss the promising prospects of using CRISPR-based technologies to dissect DNA sequences associated with neuropsychiatric diseases.},

  abstract = {During development, neural stem cells in the cerebral cortex, also known as radial glial cells (RGCs), generate excitatory neurons, followed by production of cortical macroglia and inhibitory neurons that migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB). Understanding the mechanisms for this lineage switch is fundamental for unraveling how proper numbers of diverse neuronal and glial cell types are controlled. We and others recently showed that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling promotes the cortical RGC lineage switch to generate cortical oligodendrocytes and OB interneurons. During this process, cortical RGCs generate intermediate progenitor cells that express critical gliogenesis genes

  abstract = {Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is the most highly regulated step in cellular division. We employed a chemogenetic approach to discover novel cellular networks that regulate cell cycle progression. This approach uncovered functional clusters of genes that altered sensitivity of cells to inhibitors of the G1/S transition. Mutation of components of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 rescued proliferation inhibition caused by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, but not to inhibitors of S phase or mitosis. In addition to its core catalytic subunits, mutation of the PRC2.1 accessory protein MTF2, but not the PRC2.2 protein JARID2, rendered cells resistant to palbociclib treatment. We found that PRC2.1 (MTF2), but not PRC2.2 (JARID2), was critical for promoting H3K27me3 deposition at CpG islands genome-wide and in promoters. This included the CpG islands in the promoter of the CDK4/6 cyclins CCND1 and CCND2, and loss of MTF2 lead to upregulation of both CCND1 and CCND2. Our results demonstrate a role for PRC2.1, but not PRC2.2, in antagonizing G1 progression in a diversity of cell linages, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), breast cancer, and immortalized cell lines.},
